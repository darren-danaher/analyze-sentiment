## Automated Customer Sentiment Analyzer

### Project Overview:

This project involves developing a Python-based web application that automatically classifies customer feedback into sentiment categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in Python scripting, web APIs, and AI/ML sentiment analysis.

### Tech Stack:

* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI framework)
* **AI Model:** Hugging Face Transformers (distilBERT sentiment analysis model)
* **Frontend (Optional):** React or simple HTML/CSS interface for demonstration
* **Database (Optional):** MongoDB or SQLite for storing feedback and sentiment results
* **Deployment (Optional):** Docker container

### Core Functional Requirements:

1. **API Endpoint**:

   * POST endpoint `/analyze-sentiment`
   * Accepts JSON payload: `{ "text": "Customer feedback goes here." }`
   * Returns JSON response: `{ "sentiment": "positive", "confidence": 0.95 }`

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:

   * Implement sentiment classification using Hugging Face Transformers.
   * Ensure accurate and reliable sentiment predictions.

3. **Frontend Demonstration (Optional but recommended)**:

   * Simple UI form to input customer feedback and display analyzed sentiment.

4. **Data Storage (Optional)**:

   * Optionally store input feedback along with analysis results in MongoDB or SQLite.

### Acceptable Criteria:

* API accurately classifies sentiment with at least 85% confidence.
* Response time for analysis endpoint under 1 second.
* Clear and concise documentation on setup, dependencies, and API usage.
* Code is structured, clean, well-commented, and adheres to best practices.

### Additional Recommendations:

* Include a Dockerfile to simplify deployment.
* Create a brief README with project setup instructions.
* Host the project on GitHub to showcase as a public portfolio piece.
